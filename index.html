    <h2 class="nd">About Jollof Rice (It's Origins)</h2>
    <p class="body"><b>Jollof rice</b> is to West Africa what paella is to Spain, risotto to Italy, biriyani to India and fried rice to China.
        Jollof is believed to have originated in the Senegambia region of West Africa among the Wolof people, where it is known as benachin.
        The mouth-watering meal has travelled throughout the sub-region because of the frequent cultural exchange that goes on there. As such, 
        it has evolved into several regional varieties, laced with the heritage of the place where it is prepared. Nevertheless, it maintains its 
        magic and is relished all over Africa. </p>

<h2 class="nd">How to Prepare Jollof Rice</h2>

<div class="body">
<p>1. Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor or blender for about 45 seconds, make sure that everything is blended well.</p>

<p>2. In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. Once the oil is heated add the onions you set aside and fry just until they turn golden brown. Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes. Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about 1/4 cup and set aside) and fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes. Make sure you stir consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn.</p>

<p>3. After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock. Mix and add your seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube). Continue to boil for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>4. Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew. At this point if you need to add water so that the rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so. Add the bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes.</p>

<p>5. When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew, cover, and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes heat until the liquid has completely dried up. Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!</p>

<h3 class="here">Notes</h3>
<ul class="body">
    <li>It is key to use parboiled rice so that you donâ€™t end up with mushy rice in the end.</li>
    <li>When cooking the tomato stew, you can tell when it is done because the oil will rise to the top. Also another way to tell that is done is when the bitter taste of the tomatoes has been cooked out. The reason why you reserve 1/4th of the tomato mixture and add it at the end is because we do not want the rice to burn. Also, it gives the rice that beautiful red color we all know and love.</li>
